# Path_searching_for_trajectory_planning
C++ code of UR5 trajectory path planning algorithm 

This search path algorithm takes into account all of the constraints set in the UR-5's workspace to come up with a possible
configuration pathways to move into a desired configuration set. 
It is useful for applications such as car manufacturing process such as using robotic arms to move car seats inside the chassis at a certain specific angle with precision. 

It uses breadth-first search algorithm to achieve the desired result.
